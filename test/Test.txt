Hello I am priynaka Nikam. 
I am working as software devloper.

Rajasthan comprises mostly of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert,
 facing low yields, scanty irrigation facilities, low fertility and high alkalinity of soil. 
In pursuit of creating lush green forest in middle of Thar, 
SankalpTaru is developing orchards of pomegranate and other fruit bearing trees by providing horticulture farming in the rural villages. 
This is enabling poor farmers to sustain their living efficiently, along with greenifying the desolate desert land.
